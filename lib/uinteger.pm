=head1 NAME

uinteger - like "use integer", but unsigned

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use uinteger;
  print 1 - 2; # print a large number

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Rewrites add, subtract, multiply and unary negation in C<use uinteger>
context to perform the operation as if the number was an unsigned
integer (a Perl C<UV>).

Negative numbers are treated as their 2's complement representation.

Most bitops already treat their arguments as unsigned outside of C<use
integer> so this doesn't need to cover those.
